The PYCitySchools folder contains the jupyter notebook python file as well as the csv resources needed to complete the data analysis. The file named "PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb" can be run from the jupyter notebook interface to produce the mathematical and numerical results needed for the fourth challenge.

The "Analysis of School Data.docx" file in the main pandas-challenge repository contains a semi-detailed analysis of the data with a summary of conclusions at the end of the document.
